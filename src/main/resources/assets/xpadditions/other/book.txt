XP Additons

XP also known as Experience is no secret to you. You have long last learned how to use the power of this magical substance you get from killing monsters, mining ores, cooking and other things. You used the magical power of XP to enchant your weapons, tools and armor to make them more and more powerful and finally you used XP to repair these items and found a way to give this ability to the items themselves. After doing all of these things you think you understand everything about XP...
But you are wrong! All the things you know about it are very basic and do not require any further understanding of the matter however there is more, way more!
Having found this book you probably would like to learn what is possible, so I shall give you some examples: One can use the power of XP to move objects in the world or to move items from one place to another. When done correctly one can gain new abilities like flight or swimming like a fish. And a true master can even transport him- / herself from one point to another no matter how far apart they are.
I understand that you are keen on learning more, but you need to do so slowly as nothing is more destructive than the unlished power of XP.

----Itroduction----

(You can skip this chapter safely as it is just a little background story but you might be confused when something explained here is mentioned somewhere else in the mod.)

For you to understand how to use the power of XP you first need to understand what XP is and where it comes from. So let me start at the beginning:
Everyone knows about the villagers scattered around the world in small groups that live in their little villages you probably encountered some of them already, however you never thought about the fact that they have been in this world way longer than you. Naturally this means that they know more about this world than you and you might have realised that when a cartographer could sell you a map to some sort of temple or monument. What you dont know is, that they also know a lot about XP.  They are the ones that a long time ago discovered the power of XP and harnessed it for their convenience and this helped them a lot towards gaining power in the world.
