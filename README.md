# XPAdditions

XPAdditions is a mod for Minecraft!
This mod is currently under development and will soon be released for Minecraft version 1.12.2!

XPAdditions adds a lot of interesting stuff and overhauls Minecrafts XP-System allowing you to use XP for Crafting and to get some cool gadgets and progress through your Minecraft life! With XPAdditions you will have a completely new experience fighting against mob and exploring the world. The new Items help you to build your home and allow you to have some unexpected freedom when building. For example you can craft a new Block that lights everything in a big area around it, so you can build however you want and don't need to focus on hiding Torches or Glowstone in your walls! Exploring the World also gets interesting when you find a fallen meteor on the bottom of a large crater and hopefully find some star-fragments buried inside it!

Have fun with this mod and feel free to give me some new ideas!
