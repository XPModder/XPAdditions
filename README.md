# XPAdditions

XPAdditions is a mod for Minecraft!
This mod is currently under development and will be released for Minecraft version 1.14.4!

XPAdditions adds a lot of interesting stuff and overhauls Minecrafts XP-System allowing you to use XP for Crafting and to get some cool gadgets and progress through your Minecraft life! With XPAdditions you will have a completely new experience fighting against mob and exploring the world. The new Items help you to build your home and allow you to have some unexpected freedom when building. For example you can craft a new Block that lights everything in a big area around it, so you can build however you want and don't need to focus on hiding Torches or Glowstone in your walls! Exploring the World also gets interesting when you find a fallen meteor on the bottom of a large crater and hopefully find some star-fragments buried inside it!

Have fun with this mod and feel free to give me some new ideas!

Edit: This mod was originally planned for 1.12.2 Â´, but forge has since dropped support and moved on to 1.14.4 - so I will do the same soon. 1.12.2 will never receive a release version, but will get a very early beta/late alpha version that just contains a crude implementation of the core features and is pretty much untested. This version will not be supported in any way and bugs and errors won't be fixed. Developement for 1.12.2 is officially halted and will not continue. 
Please don't report any bugs for that version!
